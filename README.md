# calcOS
OS originally intended for the RPI 0 before moving the project to pepOS on pi pico.

This project is not actively in development anymore as I shifted it over to pepOS on the pico. This is because the pi 0 isn't really the best choice for a calculator machine due to power usage, and is not all that much designed for OS development. Certain aspects of it are very much locked down (To future me: specify what these parts are, I can't remember why as this project was halted some months ago).

Uploading it here in case it is of interest to anyone, or I may use this base to turn this into something at a later date. Does boot but I believe there's something a little wrong with it as it doesn't give the required output but I'm inclined to believe this is a wrong-value for some of the config options as the correct values haven't been easy to find.
